## Introduction

COSMOS (Containerized Multi-System Assembler) is a project that aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for assembling complex systems such as CMS's, LMS's, KMS's, marketplaces, and ERP capabilities. This project is being developed with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model provided by OpenAI.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a microservices architecture, with separate containers for the backend, frontend, and any additional services such as databases or caches. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, allowing for modularity, scalability, and flexibility.

The backend component is built using the Actix framework in Rust and exposes a GraphQL API for querying and manipulating data. It utilizes Actix's asynchronous model and lightweight actors for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

The frontend component is built using Flutter and Dart, providing a cross-platform framework for building responsive user interfaces. It communicates with the Actix backend via GraphQL to fetch and display data from the assembled systems.

## Technological Stack

- **Backend**:
  - Language: Rust
  - Framework: Actix
  - GraphQL Implementation: Juniper or async-graphql
  - Data Storage: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis

- **Frontend**:
  - Framework: Flutter
  - Language: Dart
  - State Management: Provider or Riverpod
  - GraphQL Client: graphql_flutter

- **Containerization**:
  - Docker for containerizing backend and frontend components
  - Docker Compose for orchestrating multiple containers

## Getting Started

To get started with the project for local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Build the backend Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t backend .
     ```
   - Run the backend container:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 8000:8000 backend
     ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Build the frontend Docker image (if not done already):
     ```bash
     docker build -t frontend .
     ```
   - Run the frontend container (if not done already):
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 80:80 frontend
     ```

4. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost`.

## Usage

The frontend application provides a user interface for interacting with the assembled systems. Users can perform various actions such as querying data, viewing content, and managing resources. The Actix backend GraphQL API serves as the data layer, aggregating and processing data from the underlying systems.
